# 6.3.6 UCDH

UCDH's Lawson ERP system requires integration with Oracle to keep transactions in sync between Lawson and Oracle.  This is both to feed activity executed at the medical center into the campus financial system for UC reporting, but also to export transactions related to UCDH's business interests into Lawson.
