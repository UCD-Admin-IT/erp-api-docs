#### Summary

UC Davis Facilities Management and FOA Business Partners use Dynamics SL as a sub-ledger between the FM work order system (IBM TRIRIGA) and AggieEnterprise to track expenses of labor and materials on work performed on physical assets on campus (buildings, utility systems, etc.). Dynamics SL requires pipelines for posting journals to the general ledger and creating requisitions to support the purchasing process.
